# Workspace/one — Scoreboard (living: updated every turn)

Goal: **best in the world.** Legend: ✅ built+proven · 🟡 foundation/partial · ⬜ planned/backlog · ❌ absent (gap) · — n/a.
This is the running backlog + capabilities comparison. Each turn: log the delta, advance the backlog, never regress.

---

## ▶ This turn's delta (gaps bridged)
- **GDS live in the editor** — `pagerank` ("your most central ideas") + `pathBetween` ("what connects A↔B"), proven in
  noetica (9/9) and **surfaced in the Knowledge editor UI**: a Central-Ideas panel + a "what connects?" path tool.
  These are real graph computations **Notion structurally cannot do**, now visible in the product.
- **Bug fix:** unresolved `[[links]]` now materialize **stub nodes** (Roam-style) — better behavior + makes them rank.
- **Sealed persistence wired** — `knowledgeApi` (stub/local-first) + "Save to graph (sealed)" button; server path seals
  content under the root (`knowledge-persist.ts`) and stores structure for `hg_analytics`.
- **36 tests passing** (identity 18 + knowledge 9 + vault 5 + persist 4). Leapfrog is durable, GDS-real, sealed, and demoable.

### Turn log
| Turn | Shipped (proven) |
|---|---|
| T-1 | Sovereign identity architecture; broker core `sovereign-id.ts` — per-scope unlinkable facets + aliases (6/6) |
| T-2 | `provisionScopeAlias` (Senzing defeat deliverable via mail_aliases); 4-agent competitive audit + reframe |
| T-3 | Auth handshake `sovereign-broker.ts` — root never leaves edge, passkey-style (6/6); ONLYOFFICE decision |
| T-4 | OIDC issuance `sovereign-oidc.ts` (6/6); full login 18/18; this scoreboard |
| T-5 | Graph-native knowledge layer `knowledge-graph.ts` (7/7) — the Notion leapfrog; Wiki+Notes → foundation |
| T-6 | Compulsion-resistance vault `sovereign-vault.ts` (5/5); knowledge editor UI (live backlinks/rollups); DAO model. 30 tests |
| T-7 | Sealed HellGraph write-path `knowledge-persist.ts` (4/4) — durable + GDS-on-ciphertext + content sealed under root. 34 tests |
| T-8 | **GDS live in editor: PageRank "central ideas" + pathBetween "what connects A↔B" (9/9); stub-node fix; sealed persist wired. 36 tests** |

## ▶ Backlog (prioritized; world-class bar)
**P0 — Identity moat (the lead; finish it):**
1. ⬜ IdP deploy — Zitadel/Authentik Helm in prophet-workspace, calling `sovereign-broker.verify`; per-app pairwise clients. ← NEXT
2. ⬜ External-IdP relay (consume Google/corp/passkey → bind to root, strip correlation) + wire `scopeAlias`→`mail_aliases` live.
3. ⬜ Anonymous credentials (SD-JWT-VC) + `AnonymousReputationReceipt` runtime.
4. ⬜ MDM work-facet compartmentalization.
4a. ✅ Compulsion-resistance vault (`sovereign-vault.ts`) — E2E seal under root keys.
4b. ⬜ **Wire the vault into app data** (mail/drive/docs/knowledge sealed under root keys) — make "we can't read it" true end-to-end.
4c. ⬜ **User-gated trace-open** (threshold guardians; operator/DAO hold none) + social/threshold recovery.
4d. ⬜ **DAO transition** — threshold (k-of-n) IdP signing key across independent operators; no single compellable party.

**P0 — Mail to real (the cutover gate):**
5. ⬜ `workspace-mailapi` IMAP/JMAP↔REST bridge; wire Vue Mail off stub; choir summary/draft actions.

**P1 — The offensive leapfrog + suite breadth:**
6. ⬜ Graph-native knowledge layer (block editor on HellGraph; docs/db/entities = nodes; choir-native; CRDT-synced).
7. ⬜ ONLYOFFICE (WOPI) + LibreOffice-headless conv · Matrix deploy · object-store Drive/Photos · Radicale Calendar/Contacts UIs.

**P2 — Glue + new categories:**
8. ⬜ Unified search (wire sherlock) · Admin console (surface orggov) · Notifications (Matrix push).
9. ⬜ Work-mgmt (Projects) · Wiki · Canvas (Excalidraw/tldraw) · Flows (choir agents).
10. ⬜ E2E encryption posture decision (vs Proton) · governed sharing UI (scope-d).

**P3 — Reach:**
11. ⬜ Mobile (native DAV/IMAP first) · Linux-first developer program + app marketplace · compliance/DLP.
