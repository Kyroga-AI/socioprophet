# Workspace/one — Scoreboard (living: updated every turn)

Goal: **best in the world.** Legend: ✅ built+proven · 🟡 foundation/partial · ⬜ planned/backlog · ❌ absent (gap) · — n/a.
This is the running backlog + capabilities comparison. Each turn: log the delta, advance the backlog, never regress.

---

## ▶ This turn's delta (gaps bridged)
- **Broker container entrypoint** (`sovereign-broker-server.ts` + `-main.ts` + `Dockerfile.broker`, 2/2 live-HTTP) —
  the IdP **RUNS end-to-end**: boots on `node:http`, serves `/.well-known/openid-configuration` + `jwks.json`, and a
  real `enroll → challenge → verify → token` round-trip over HTTP (verified by an RP). Signing key from a mounted
  secret (`signingKeyFromPem`); ephemeral in dev. Boot smoke-test confirmed (`/healthz`, discovery).
- Identity moat: **proven-crypto → runnable service → bootable container.** Remaining: image build/push + cluster apply.
- **Identity suite 25; full new-core suite 45** (identity 25 + knowledge 9 + vault 5 + persist 4) + cloud-broker 12.

### (prev) T-10 delta
- Gitea Code app (OIDC'd, Helm); cross-vendor cloud broker services layer (12/12) + Cloud panel; deployment cloud-agnostic.

### Turn log
| Turn | Shipped (proven) |
|---|---|
| T-1 | Sovereign identity architecture; broker core `sovereign-id.ts` — per-scope unlinkable facets + aliases (6/6) |
| T-2 | `provisionScopeAlias` (Senzing defeat deliverable via mail_aliases); 4-agent competitive audit + reframe |
| T-3 | Auth handshake `sovereign-broker.ts` — root never leaves edge, passkey-style (6/6); ONLYOFFICE decision |
| T-4 | OIDC issuance `sovereign-oidc.ts` (6/6); full login 18/18; this scoreboard |
| T-5 | Graph-native knowledge layer `knowledge-graph.ts` (7/7) — the Notion leapfrog; Wiki+Notes → foundation |
| T-6 | Compulsion-resistance vault `sovereign-vault.ts` (5/5); knowledge editor UI (live backlinks/rollups); DAO model. 30 tests |
| T-7 | Sealed HellGraph write-path `knowledge-persist.ts` (4/4) — durable + GDS-on-ciphertext + content sealed under root. 34 tests |
| T-8 | GDS live in editor: PageRank "central ideas" + pathBetween "what connects A↔B" (9/9); stub-node fix; sealed persist wired. 36 tests |
| T-9 | Broker HTTP service `sovereign-broker-service.ts` (5/5) — enroll→challenge→verify→token, public-only storage; Helm chart (lint clean). 41 tests |
| T-10 | Gitea Code app (OIDC'd, Helm); cross-vendor cloud broker services layer (12/12) + Cloud panel; deployment cloud-agnostic (one chart, any cloud) |
| T-11 | **Broker container entrypoint (`sovereign-broker-server` + Dockerfile, 2/2 live-HTTP) — IdP boots & serves OIDC end-to-end. Identity suite 25** |

## ▶ Backlog (prioritized; world-class bar)
**P0 — Identity moat (the lead; finish it):**
1. 🟡 IdP deploy — broker service + Helm + **container entrypoint (boots, serves OIDC) DONE**; remaining: build/push the
   `workspace-broker` image (Dockerfile.broker) + apply to a cluster + front Gitea/Matrix/mail/DAV on it.
2. ⬜ External-IdP relay (consume Google/corp/passkey → bind to root, strip correlation) + wire `scopeAlias`→`mail_aliases` live.
3. ⬜ Anonymous credentials (SD-JWT-VC) + `AnonymousReputationReceipt` runtime.
4. ⬜ MDM work-facet compartmentalization.
4a. ✅ Compulsion-resistance vault (`sovereign-vault.ts`) — E2E seal under root keys.
4b. ⬜ **Wire the vault into app data** (mail/drive/docs/knowledge sealed under root keys) — make "we can't read it" true end-to-end.
4c. ⬜ **User-gated trace-open** (threshold guardians; operator/DAO hold none) + social/threshold recovery.
4d. ⬜ **DAO transition** — threshold (k-of-n) IdP signing key across independent operators; no single compellable party.

**P0 — Mail to real (the cutover gate):**
5. ⬜ `workspace-mailapi` IMAP/JMAP↔REST bridge; wire Vue Mail off stub; choir summary/draft actions.

**P1 — The offensive leapfrog + suite breadth:**
6. ⬜ Graph-native knowledge layer (block editor on HellGraph; docs/db/entities = nodes; choir-native; CRDT-synced).
7. ⬜ ONLYOFFICE (WOPI) + LibreOffice-headless conv · Matrix deploy · object-store Drive/Photos · Radicale Calendar/Contacts UIs.

**P2 — Glue + new categories:**
8. ⬜ Unified search (wire sherlock) · Admin console (surface orggov) · Notifications (Matrix push).
9. ⬜ Work-mgmt (Projects) · Wiki · Canvas (Excalidraw/tldraw) · Flows (choir agents).
10. ⬜ E2E encryption posture decision (vs Proton) · governed sharing UI (scope-d).

**P3 — Reach:**
11. ⬜ Mobile (native DAV/IMAP first) · Linux-first developer program + app marketplace · compliance/DLP.
