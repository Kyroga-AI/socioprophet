## Folder Structure Conventions

SocioProphet's source code is nested beneath the `src` directories. For deployment, `yoke` assumes that all the files (including the index page) required to run in `release` mode have been written to a directory called either `dist` or `build` off the root. Grunt or Gulp both have good facilities for writing the outputs of a task to a different directory.
